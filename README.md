ðŸ–– Web analytics. ðŸ––

## motivation ##

An explorative way of learning how web analytics works at scale.

* Vulcan aims to:

  - Be fast.
  - Handle many requests.
  - Have strong opinions.
  - Be a compelling choice for individuals, organizations and companies.
  - Be self-hosted, open source, easily extended.
  - Follow best practices.

* Area of focus:

  - Collecting analytics.
  - Storing collected information.
  - Simple (not feature rich) reporting out of the box.

* Strategy:

  - To scale, use sharding around collection endpoints where possible, so;
  - Kong can be used as a front between APIs;
  - Separation between services which isolate:
      a. HTTP GET requests for analytics,
      b. storage and retrieval of site specific data
      c. presentation of retrieved analytics

## services ##

The project is broken down into four major component services which have their
respective areas of concern: gathering analytics, storing and retrieving
records, generating and displaying reports, and providing documentation with
examples;

1. beacon

  - Tracker endpoint which handles the request payload.
  - Uses HTTP 204 No Content instead of a 1x1 transparent gif (Saving 35? bytes)
  - Runs against 127.0.0.1:8000 as vulcan-beacon

2. katric

  - Handles database storage and retrieval operations between gocql and scylla.
  - Runs against 127.0.0.1:8001 as vulcan-katric

3. scuttlebutt

  - Client service to handle reporting.
  - Works with a local copy of sharded ark data from katric.
  - a report (often malicious) about the behavior of other people.
  - Runs against 127.0.0.1:8002 as vulcan-scuttlebutt

4. ellipsis

  - Server with example index.html that includes a tracker.
  - (hopefully) includes extensive test client runs in excess of 10k requests,
    with different payloads and tests.
  - Runs against 127.0.0.1:8003 as vulcan-ellipsis
